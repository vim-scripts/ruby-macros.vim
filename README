This plugin is for editing ruby files.

Typing "for" on a blank line will result in

for  in  
end

with the cursor positioned before the "in".  
The same will happen with "while", "until", 
and so on.  But if the line is not blank,
"for" will just insert itself.

Also, symbols like " are inserted in matching
pairs, with the cursor in between.

"K" runs ruby on the current buffer, and 
the "F1" function key puts a line
#!/usr/math/bin/ruby
on the first line.  (You will have to edit 
this part).
